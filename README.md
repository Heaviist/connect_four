# connect_four
The Odin Project's Connect Four Project in Ruby

# Assignment
Build Connect Four! Just be sure to keep it TDD.

# Goal
Create a Connect Four game in the terminal. Use TDD along the way to first write tests, then write code, to eventually create the full project.

# Expectations and challenges
1. Writing tests for everything before writing the code feels very counterintuitive still.
2. I assume it will be good for thinking over the basic steps of creating the program. I also expect TDD helps in keeping methods clear and simple.
3. Overall, the ruby code seems to be fairly straightforward for this, though I expect to run into some small issues.
4. Finding the right way to test methods might become a struggle and Googlefest, but hopefully in the end, we will get there.
